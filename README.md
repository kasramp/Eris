## <a name="details">Details</a>
Eris is a simple [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) Java API service that is developed as a consolidation of the following services:

- [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)
- [Open Street Map](http://openstreetmap.org/)
- [Group Kt](http://www.groupkt.com/post/f2129b88/services.htm)
- [IP API](http://ip-api.com/)

The technology stack solely consists of Spring Boot framework.
The live version of the API service is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
The service can be hosted in any platform that supports Spring Boot.

Feel free to fork the project and create your own private API instance.

## <a name="dependencies">Dependencies</a>
All the project dependencies exist in `pom.xml` file and once you run the project, all dependencies will be downloaded.

## <a name="apicall">API documentation</a>
Eris has two APIs which both do the same thing, getting the current weather condition.

Each API designed for its own use case, though both give the same response.

To access the APIs need to perform `get` request on the following URLs:

- [/v1/weather/current](#current)
- [/v1/weather/currentbyip](#currentbyip)

### <a name="current">/v1/weather/current</a>
This endpoint is suitable for the case that coordinates (latitude, longitude) are available.
To use this API three URL parameters are required which two are compulsory and another one is optional.

The list of parameters with their description can be found in below table

Parameter | Description |Type | Compulsory
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
lat | Latitude | Decimal | &#10004;
lon | Longitude | Decimal | &#10004;
fahrenheit | Temperature scale, supported Fahrenheit (`true`) and Celsius (`false`, default). If Fahrenheit sets to `true`, the wind speed unit will be changed to miles/hour, otherwise meter/sec | Boolean | &#10008;

The JSON response of the call is something similar to below:

```
{
   "country":"Malaysia",
   "geoLocation":"Suria KLCC, Jalan Ampang, Taman U-Thant, Kampung Baru, Selangor-Kuala Lumpur Borders, 50088, Malaysia",
   "temperature":28.54,
   "icon":"http://openweathermap.org/img/w/04n.png",
   "iconName":"04n",
   "feelsLike":33.12,
   "errors":[

   ],
   "apiVersion":"v1.0",
   "coord":{
      "lat":"3.1569485999999998",
      "lon":"101.71230299999999"
   },
   "weather":[
      {
         "id":803,
         "main":"Clouds",
         "description":"broken clouds",
         "icon":"04n"
      }
   ],
   "base":"stations",
   "main":{
      "temp":28.54,
      "pressure":1010,
      "humidity":78,
      "temp_min":28,
      "temp_max":29,
      "sea_level":0,
      "grnd_level":0
   },
   "visibility":"10000",
   "wind":{
      "speed":0.5,
      "deg":0
   },
   "clouds":{
      "all":75
   },
   "dt":1507039200,
   "sys":{
      "countryNameFull":"Malaysia",
      "type":1,
      "id":8138,
      "message":0.0053,
      "country":"MY",
      "sunrise":1506985181,
      "sunset":1507028660
   },
   "id":1735162,
   "name":"Setapak",
   "cod":200
}
```

If none numeric or empty `lat` and/or `lon` given to the endpoint, the API returns `400 Bad Request` with appropriate error response similar to the following payload structure. Same is true if the API fails to process the request except `500 Internal Server Error` returns.


```
{
country": null,
  "geoLocation": null,
  "temperature": null,
  "icon": null,
  "iconName": null,
  "feelsLike": 0,
  "errors": [
    "Appropriate error message"
  ],
  "apiVersion": "v1.0",
  "coord": null,
  "weather": null,
  "base": null,
  "main": null,
  "visibility": null,
  "wind": null,
  "clouds": null,
  "dt": null,
  "sys": null,
  "id": null,
  "name": null,
  "cod": null
}

```

### <a name="currentbyip">/v1/weather/currentbyip</a>
This point suits when no coordinates are available. As a result, the weather condition retrieved via the caller IP address location.
Obviously, compare with the `/current`, this endpoint has lower accuracy.
The reason for this is because coordinates acquired based on IP address which is usually not the same with the user's location.
In most cases, the location of the IP refers to the nearest ISP center that the user is connected to.
The API parameters are as follows:

Parameter | Description |Type | Compulsory
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
fahrenheit | Temperature scale, supported Fahrenheit (`true`) and Celsius (`false`, default). If Fahrenheit sets to `true`, the wind speed unit will be changed to miles/hour, otherwise meter/sec | Boolean | &#10008;

The IP address retrieved automatically from request header and as it can be seen, no parameter is defined to manually determine it.
The response of this endpoint is identical with the `/current` one.

### <a name="examples">Examples</a>
To call the endpoints, you need to send `get` request with appropriate URL parameters.

The request URL for `/current` should be something similar to this.

[http://weather-api.madadipouya.com/v1/weather/current?lat=3.15694859&lon=101.7123029&fahrenheit=false](http://weather-api.madadipouya.com/v1/weather/current?lat=3.15694859&lon=101.7123029&fahrenheit=false)

Consequently, the request URL for `/currentbyip` should be similar to below:

[http://weather-api.madadipouya.com/v1/weather/currentbyip?fahrenheit=false](http://weather-api.madadipouya.com/v1/weather/currentbyip?fahrenheit=false)

In Unix/Linux, you can use `curl` command to call the service.

`curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET 'http://weather-api.madadipouya.com/v1/weather/current?lat=3.15694859&lon=101.7123029&fahrenheit=false'`

Or

`curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET 'http://weather-api.madadipouya.com/v1/weather/currentbyip?fahrenheit=false'`

## <a name="deployment">Deploy your own Eris instance</a>
To run and deploy the project on your local or any desired server, first clone the project and then follow the below instructions.

- Add Open Weather Map API key to `apikey.properties` that located under `resource` folder.
- Compile and run the API using Maven

        $ maven clean install
        $ cd target
        $ java -jar eris-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

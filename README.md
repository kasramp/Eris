Eris is a simple Spring Boot Java API that is developed as a consolidation of the following services:

- [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)
- [Open Street Map](http://openstreetmap.org/)
- [Group Kt](http://www.groupkt.com/post/f2129b88/services.htm)

The technology stack solely consists of [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) framework only.
The live version of the API service is hosted on [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/).
